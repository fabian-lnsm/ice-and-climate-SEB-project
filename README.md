## Python project to investigate climate data from antarctica

This project uses observations from a weather station in antarctica to determine the difference influences to the surface temperature and melt.

## Configuration

The code is written for Python 3.10 and uses only the following modules: Numpy 1.26, Matplotlib 3.8, Seaborn, sklearn and Datetime.

The exact requirements to run the project are listed in the environment file which was created using conda.
The environment can be reproduced with the following command:

```
